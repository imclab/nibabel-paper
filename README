NiBabel Paper
=============

This is becoming a manuscript on NiBabel and its development. To be published
somewhere. All contributors are invited to participate.

Guidelines
----------

Keep it simple. If you want to add a code snippet, just add a .py file and
`\input{}` the corresponding .py.tex in the manuscript -- look inside for an
example. `make` builds a PDF -- any decent Latex distribution should be
sufficient. Don't forget to add your name and affiliation. Add references
to the BIB file. Use natbib style citations.
